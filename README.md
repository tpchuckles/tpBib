# What is it?
tpBib is a simple command line python tool for keeping your journal articles organized. Put your pdfs in a folder and run the code. Once your files are scanned, you can search, generate bibtex, and run duplicate-checking. Subfolders are allowed. Moving files should not require reindexing. 

# Why?
I was a long-time user of Mendelay, but it's really gone downhill. People were recommending Zotero, but I operate under a file-centric world-view; without a "watch folder" feature, I'm out. 

# How do I use it?
Download tpBib.py, put it in your pdfs folder, and run it. If the menu options aren't self-explanatory, please let me know. "Admin menu" is where you'll scan the folder (and subfolders), run duplicate-checking, etc. Search and generate bibtex from the main menu. If you move files into folders, rescanning should detect that the file has moved. 

# Bro this code sucks
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
